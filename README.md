# TypingTroller-V1.0
This is a typing Bot written in python by utilizing the selenium framework . Feel free to browse through the code . Currently i've written 8 different test cases for different websites (Since the DOM was different) .

I do not hold any responsiblity for any of its misusage . This is just the utilization of the framework to automate typing .

PS: Some sites require accounts to be made . (I've added to commnents which can be tweaked a little to login and perform speedy typing)


HOW TO USE 

1.Install Python 2.x
2.Install Selenium (Can use PIP or Easy-Install)
        pip install selenium
3.Install Chrome Driver http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.9/chromedriver_win32.zip (You can do in on firefox too , but you have to just replace chrome with Firefox in the source code )

Thats it . You are Ready to go .
